## whoami

I am an engaged cat-dad who hacks for a living.

Before learning how to capital-h 'Hack', I was always a [hacker](https://web.archive.org/web/20160516153012/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1392). 

I want to know how things work.

## Interests

I spend time hacking, tinkering, making music, playing [video/board]games, and more. I wanted a space to share what I am doing and hopefully provide help/insight for others with similar interests.

Overall, most things technology-related interest me. This includes using technology, but it also includes the ethics and philosophy surrounding it.

Why have we collectively decided that `progress == making rocks think harder`?
